                        <h3>In 1971 Mohiuddin Jahangir was working at the construction field at Karakoram. On 10 June he took a few days leave and went back to Risalpur. One day later, he started towards the Sialkot border to reach India. He managed to cross the border safely and joined the Mukti Bahini at Mehdipur under Maldah district in West Bengal. On 3 July, he became a captain of sector 7. He was given the responsibility to fight at the Chapai Nawabganj border at Rajshahi district. In December he was again given the same duty of conquering Chapai Nawabganj. On 14 December he died after being shot during a battle near Nawabganj. He was buried near Shona Masjid premises and later was posthumously declared “Bir Shrestho”.</h3>
